// That is, to create a valid sbt build, all you've got to do is define the

// Lines like the above defining `scalaVersion` are called "settings" Settings
// are key/value pairs. In the case of `scalaVersion`, the key is "scalaVersion"
// and the value is "2.12.8"

// It's possible to define many kinds of settings, such as:

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
    .settings(
        name := "hello-world",
        organization := "ch.epfl.scala",

        mainClass in run := Some("with_monads.Main"),

        // Note, it's not required for you to define these three settings. These are
        // mostly only necessary if you intend to publish your library's binaries on a
        // place like Sonatype or Bintray.
